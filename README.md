This repository contains the project that I realized for the Computational Social Science course within the Master's programme in Data Science at the University of Trento. The course was taught by Professor Giuseppe Veltri. You can find:
- Analysis.ipynb (a jupyter notebook for the analysis)
- Tweeting about #AOC.pdf (the report)
- data_collection.ipynb (a jupyter notebook for the tweets collection)
- topic_modelling.html (to visualize the topics extracted through topic modelling)

In addition, the folder data contains part of the data being used.

## Assignment 
<i> Assignment Details </i>. The aim of this assignment is that you develop a research project for a hypothetical study. You ought to discuss one method of those you have seen during the lectures (e.g. online interviews, online survey, opinion mining, social network analysis, etc.) in its potential advantages and disadvantages. Remember, you need to provide some details about how you are going to use the method. Be aware that you have a word limitation of max 3,000 words so use the space wisely. 
What the methodology section should contain:
- The data that you want to use and a description of the dataset
- The analytical strategy that you want to employ, which technique (PCA, Cluster analysis, Decision Trees, Text mining -topic modelling)
- An example of analysis from the dataset you have selected
-The interpretation of results.

## The project
I decided to investigate what people tweet about <b>Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez</b>, one of the most famous congresswomen in the US. I provide an exploratory analysis of the contents of tweets that mention her, to illustrate what topics Twitter users link to her and whom and what they connect her with. To find such connections, I first look for the most common words. Then I focus on the most popular bigrams and trigrams. Finally, I conduct a topic modelling analysis, which is a method to identify the main theme covered by a large collection of documents. To do so, I rely on the most popular algorithm for topic modelling, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). To sum up, this project intends to answer the following questions: 
- R1) What are the most common words of the tweets related to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez? 
- R2) What words are linked together in terms of co-occurrences? 
- R3) What are the main topics of the tweets?

<i>NB: the analysis was carried out before the latest American election. </i>
